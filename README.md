## ~ 77th-director-bot ~
<p>Developed a bot for use on the Discord platform by utilizing the Discord.py Python library. The bot is mainly used by Genshin Impact players/fans and is based on the popular game character 'Hu Tao'. Flask was used to create a web server that is pinged every 5 minutes using UptimeRobot. This is so the bot can run the web server and maintain its uptime.</p>
